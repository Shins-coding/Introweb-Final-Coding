      <h3>Intel Core Series Overview</h3>

      <h4>Core i3</h4>
      <p>
        Entry-level CPUs designed for budget and everyday computing. Typically 4 cores and 8 threads with no efficiency cores in recent generations. Suitable for web browsing, office work, media playback, and casual gaming. Includes integrated UHD graphics for displays without the need for a discrete GPU.
      </p>

      <h4>Core i5</h4>
      <p>
        Mid-range CPUs balancing solid performance with efficiency. Usually 6 to 14 cores with a mix of performance and efficiency cores, supporting 12 to 20 threads. Popular for mainstream gaming, multitasking, and moderate content creation. Often paired with discrete GPUs but have capable integrated UHD graphics.
      </p>

      <h4>Core i7</h4>
      <p>
        High-performance processors aimed at enthusiasts and professional users. Typically 8 to 20 cores (performance + efficiency) with 16 to 28 threads. Excels in high-end gaming, streaming, video editing, and other demanding workloads. Integrated UHD graphics available, though most high-end setups use discrete GPUs.
      </p>

      <h4>Core i9</h4>
      <p>
        Premium enthusiast and professional-grade CPUs with up to 24 cores and 32 threads. Designed for extreme multitasking, professional workstations, 4K/VR gaming, and heavy rendering. Highest clock speeds and largest cache sizes with higher power consumption. Usually require discrete GPUs, though some workstation models offer integrated graphics.

    <section class="intel-info-note">
      <p>
        <strong>More Info:</strong> The first digit(s) after "Core i" indicates the generation of the processor. For example: 10xxx = 10th generation, 11xxx = 11th generation, 12xxx = 12th generation, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second digit indicates the performance tier or market segment (3 - Entry-level, 5 - Mid-range, 7 - High-performance, 9 - Enthusiast).
      </p>
      <p>
        The last two or three digits represent the SKU or specific model within that tier and generation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suffix letters signify special features, such as K (overclocking), F (no iGPU), etc.
